You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# Example : '23'
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇

column = int(position[0])  # 2 is now int
row = int(position[1]) # 3 is now int 

map[row -1][column - 1] = "X"

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
